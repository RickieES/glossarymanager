glossarymanager
===============

This is test project for a Glossary Manager written in java SE with Swing, Derby and JPA. It will eventually be part of
bigger program, LocalizeThat!, used for localization of Mozilla software that will replace MozillaTranslator.

Both glossarymanager and localizethat projects are part of my long-standing final year project, so despite being open source,
unfortunately I can't accept contributions until I get the degree.

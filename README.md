glossarymanager
===============

This is test project for a Glossary Manager written in java SE with Swing, Derby
and JPA. It will eventually be part of a bigger program, LocalizeThat!, used for
localization of Mozilla software that will replace MozillaTranslator
(https://kenai.com/projects/moztrans).

Both glossarymanager and localizethat projects are part of my long-standing
final year project, so despite being open source, unfortunately I can't accept
contributions until I get the degree.
